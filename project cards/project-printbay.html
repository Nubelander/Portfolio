            <p>
                PrintBay Studio is a hands-on letterpress and printmaking space connected to Purdue's 
                PATTeRN research initiative. Students love the studio, with its tactile, experimental nature 
                draws them in. But the website told a different story.
            </p>
            <p>
                The existing site was <strong>outdated, confusing, and inaccessible</strong>. Key 
                information was buried in PDFs. Internal jargon alienated newcomers. Students couldn't 
                find basic details like workshop schedules or how to get involved. The digital presence 
                didn't match the studio's dynamic, welcoming reality.
            </p>
            <p class="highlight-box">
                "A key challenge was translating the studio's vibrant, experimental culture into a 
                digital space. The existing language felt outdated and failed to communicate the 
                dynamism students experience in person."

            <h2>Understanding the Gap</h2>
            <p>
                To uncover what wasn't working, I conducted <strong>heuristic evaluations</strong> 
                of the existing site and <strong>user interviews</strong> with students during the 
                summer semester, when campus engagement was naturally lower.
            </p>
            
            <h3>What I Found</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Introductory content separated in a PDF increased cognitive load but users expected info to be directly on the page</li>
                <li>Low readability due to poor color contrast made text difficult to scan</li>
                <li>Confusing layout with rotated text made content genuinely hard to read</li>
                <li>Overemphasis on decorative design obscured actual meaning and accessibility</li>
                <li>Students were confused about the relationship between PrintBay and PATTeRN</li>
                <li>Participants struggled to find staff contact info, workshop schedules, and enrollment forms</li>
                <li>Users expected hyperlinks, newsletters, and functional forms, all of which were missing</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>The Real Mental Model</h2>
            <p>
                Students' mental model starts with <strong>PrintBay</strong> as the main entry point, 
                not PATTeRN. To improve engagement, the website needed to prioritize accessible content, 
                showcase the studio's energetic presentation, and create clear pathways for student involvement.

        <!-- Mid-Fidelity Rejection -->
        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>The Mid-Fidelity Pivot</h2>
            <figure class="image-figure">
                    <div class="image-placeholder">
                        <img src="../assets/works/pb/midfi.png" alt="mid-fidelity design">
                    </div>
                    <figcaption class="image-subtitle">Mid-fidelity Screens</figcaption>
                </figure> <br>
            <p>
                With the wireframes approved, I moved into a mid-fidelity prototype that built directly 
                on the layout my client had signed off on. The structure was clearer, the hierarchy 
                improved, and the navigation made sense. I felt confident presenting it.
            </p>
            <p>
                The client, however, had a different reaction. Despite having <strong>approved the 
                layout direction earlier</strong>, he now felt the homepage relied too heavily on 
                materials carried over from the old website. He wanted the studio's digital presence 
                to feel entirely fresh with <strong>no reuse of legacy imagery, text blocks, or visual 
                patterns from the original site</strong> on the homepage.
            </p>
            <p class="highlight-box">
                "The client's feedback was clear: the homepage needed to stand on its own. Even though 
                the layout had been approved, the content within it still carried the weight of the 
                old site and that wasn't the direction he envisioned for the studio."
            </p>
            <p>
                Rather than trying to salvage the prototype, I made the decision to <strong>start the 
                homepage from scratch</strong>. I went back to the reference sites and additional 
                inspirations my client had shared with me, studying how other studios and creative 
                spaces presented themselves online. This time, I focused less on restructuring the 
                existing content and more on <strong>letting the studio's identity lead</strong> by using 
                new visual storytelling, fresh imagery, and a layout that felt like a departure rather 
                than a revision.
            </p>
            <p>
                This pivot was ultimately what shaped the final design. The earlier research and 
                wireframing work wasn't wasted though, as it gave me a deep understanding of the information 
                architecture and user needs. But the visual direction needed to be <strong>reimagined 
                from the ground up</strong> to match the energy my client wanted to project.

                "Visual design is not decoration. It's a core part of communication."
            </p>
            <p>
                This project taught me that <strong>client feedback can signal deeper issues</strong>. 
                When the mid-fidelity designs didn't capture the studio's character, it wasn't just 
                about colors or fonts. <strong>It meant the layout and hierarchy needed rethinking.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Meaningful iteration often requires <strong>revisiting layout and hierarchy</strong>, 
                not just surface-level refinements. Designing within institutional constraints also 
                requires strategic trade-offs between branding consistency and user-centered clarity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even with limited access to users during the summer semester, <strong>qualitative 
                insights from consistent patterns</strong> in interviews strongly informed the structure 
                and direction of the redesign.

            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                As <strong>the leader</strong> for a 6-person team, I directed a 4-month enterprise UX 
                redesign project for Allegion, a global security products company. The project focused on 
                optimizing an internal request process that was taking 2-3 months, with the goal of reducing 
                it to 2-3 weeks.
            </p>
            <p>
                My responsibilities included defining research strategy, coordinating team workflows, 
                leading the prototyping track from low  to high-fidelity, and serving as the primary liaison 
                to industry sponsors throughout the project lifecycle.

        </section>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>The Challenge</h2>
            <p>
                The existing internal application process was creating significant bottlenecks for employees. 
                What should have been a straightforward request workflow was taking <strong>2-3 months</strong> 
                from submission to completion, causing frustration and reduced productivity across the organization.

                "Our goal was to reduce processing time by 90% while maintaining necessary approval workflows 
                and security protocols."

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Key Learnings</h2>
            
            <p class="highlight-box">
                "Leading a team project taught me that clear communication and strategic delegation are 
                just as important as design skills."
            </p>

            <h3>Team Leadership & Collaboration</h3>
            <p>
                I took the initiative to create and maintain the project timeline, which helped us monitor 
                progress and stay on pace with deliverables. Before transitioning between design phases, I made 
                it a priority to confirm all team members were on the same page, which minimized miscommunication 
                and promoted cohesive decision-making.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Proactive conflict resolution</strong> - Addressed team disagreements promptly to ensure problems were resolved before the next class, maintaining progress and team cohesion</li>
                <li><strong>Strategic delegation</strong> - Assigned prototyping tasks based on individual skillsets, offering assistance with tools and interactive components to help teammates complete work on time</li>
                <li><strong>Supportive environment</strong> - Fostered a team culture where support and accountability were shared values, ensuring everyone felt empowered to contribute</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Technical Specialization & Mentorship</h3>
            <p>
                I served as the main refiner of the high-fidelity prototype, taking full responsibility for 
                transforming our collective design work into a fully interactive, polished final product. This 
                involved adjusting layouts, building components, and ensuring interaction consistency within Figma.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Deep prototyping expertise</strong> - Became the go-to resource for design modifications and technical issues, demonstrating depth in UX production skills</li>
                <li><strong>Knowledge sharing</strong> - Taught teammates about tools, methods, and broader UX design practice expectations through hands-on collaboration</li>
                <li><strong>Quality control</strong> - Maintained design consistency and interaction fidelity across all deliverables</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Stakeholder Management & Communication</h3>
            <p>
                As primary liaison between the team and industry sponsor, I managed all external correspondence 
                and ensured information flowed clearly between stakeholders. I also set up all user interviews process, from scheduling, securing rooms, to setting up virtual links in order
                to support a smooth research process.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Professional communication</strong> - Sent emails, managed sponsor relationships, and presented UX methods to diverse audiences</li>
                <li><strong>Research facilitation</strong> - Actively participated in interviews by guiding discussions, asking clarifying questions, and maintaining a professional atmosphere</li>
                <li><strong>Project coordination</strong> - Balanced client needs with team capabilities while meeting academic and professional standards</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Integrated Learning</h3>
            <p>
                This project reinforced that effective UX leadership requires balancing hands-on technical work 
                with team coordination. Leading prototyping while also managing stakeholder communication taught 
                me to context-switch between detailed design work and high-level strategic thinking. Most 
                importantly, I learned that supporting teammates' growth and maintaining team cohesion are just 
                as critical to project success as delivering polished designs.

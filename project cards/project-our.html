        <h2>Context</h2>
        <p>
            The Purdue Office of Undergraduate Research (OUR) supports students in finding, funding, and completing
            research projects across campus. While the office had developed a detailed <strong>printed pathway</strong>
            explaining the steps from discovering opportunities to presenting research, students still struggled to
            navigate the web experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our Experience Studio team was tasked with designing a <strong>guided web pathway</strong> that translates
            this print artifact into an interactive experience. The goal was to align the website with how students
            actually search for research, while preserving the clarity and structure of the original pathway.

        <h2>Team & My Role</h2>
        <p>
            This project was completed as part of Purdue’s <strong>Experience Studio</strong>, in collaboration with the
            Office of Undergraduate Research. Our nine-person team included students with strengths in research,
            interaction design, content strategy, and visual design.
        </p>
        <p>
            Within the team, I focused on <strong>research synthesis, user flow design, and documentation</strong>:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Helped shape interview protocols and current-state tasks based on the printed pathway.</li>
            <li>Co-led synthesis activities like affinity diagramming and insight clustering.</li>
            <li>Mapped multi-entry user flows that fed directly into our low- and mid-fidelity prototypes.</li>
            <li>Contributed to the <strong>design documentation and annotated user flow</strong> delivered back to OUR.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>
            Students knew that Purdue OUR existed, but the digital experience made it difficult to act on that
            awareness. The pathway looked clear on paper, yet the website felt scattered, text-heavy, and hard to
            navigate—especially for students with little or no research experience.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Unclear starting points</strong> – A single “Get Started” entry point did not reflect the
                different goals of new, returning, and advanced student researchers.</li>
            <li><strong>Hidden information</strong> – Key resources like OURConnect, staff contact info, and funding
                details were buried in dropdowns or external links.</li>
            <li><strong>Inconsistent project details</strong> – Opportunities were listed, but content and structure
                varied, making it hard to compare options or understand requirements.</li>
            <li><strong>Underused support resources</strong> – Students expected guides, FAQs, and step-by-step help,
                but struggled to find them in the current layout.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="highlight-box">
            Students weren’t just missing information—they were missing <strong>orientation</strong>. The website
            needed to act as a guide through the research journey, not just a collection of links.

        <h2>Understanding the Current Experience</h2>
        <h3>User & Stakeholder Interviews</h3>
        <p>
            We interviewed <strong>11 undergraduate</strong> and <strong>3 graduate</strong> students who had engaged
            with research at Purdue. Graduate students helped us understand the broader research process and reflect on
            their own undergraduate journeys.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Students appreciated that OUR listed many research topics and departments, but felt overwhelmed by
                scattered information.</li>
            <li>External documents and long pages slowed them down; they preferred <strong>short, scannable navigation</strong>
                with clear labels.</li>
            <li>Faculty contact info and research opportunities were often <strong>hidden in dropdowns or external portals</strong>,
                making discovery feel like trial and error.</li>
            <li>Students expected supplemental resources (guides, FAQ, examples) that explained how to apply, present,
                and stay involved in research.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Comparative Analysis</h3>
        <p>
            To avoid re‑inventing the wheel, we benchmarked Purdue OUR against peer institutions in the Big Ten and
            beyond, including Northwestern, UCLA, Washington, and others.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Minimalist layouts</strong> made opportunities easier to scan and reduced cognitive load.</li>
            <li>Clear <strong>“start here” entry points</strong> differentiated audiences (new researchers, returning
                students, faculty).</li>
            <li>Well-structured opportunity catalogs surfaced filters (topic, time commitment, department) up front.</li>
            <li>Dedicated <strong>FAQ and resource hubs</strong> were easy to find and broken into digestible sections.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Current State Testing</h3>
        <p>
            We ran <strong>current state tests</strong> with 10 undergraduates using the existing Purdue OUR website,
            asking them to complete tasks derived from the print pathway while thinking aloud.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Students entered the site with <strong>different goals</strong> (finding a mentor, funding, conferences),
                but were all funneled into the same “Get Started” path.</li>
            <li>Inconsistent project descriptions created confusion about eligibility, expectations, and next steps.</li>
            <li>OURConnect, a powerful search tool, was <strong>hard to discover</strong> and rarely the first place
                students clicked.</li>

    <div class="section-divider">
        <span>Key Insights</span>
    </div>

    <section class="content-section">
        <h2>What We Learned</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Different students need different starting points.</strong> A first-year student “just curious”
                about research should not see the same entry flow as a student ready to apply for a conference.</li>
            <li><strong>Linear pathways don’t map well to web behavior.</strong> The print infographic implied a
                straight line; in reality, students jump in and out at multiple stages.</li>
            <li><strong>Orientation and feedback matter as much as content.</strong> Students wanted confirmation that
                they were “on the right track” and weren’t missing hidden steps.</li>
            <li><strong>OUR’s unique tools were under-leveraged.</strong> Features like OURConnect and staff support
                only worked if the site clearly surfaced when and why to use them.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="highlight-box">
            Our design challenge became: <strong>how might we turn a static pathway into a flexible,
            multi‑entry web experience that still feels guided and reassuring?</strong>
        </p>
    </section>

    <div class="section-divider">
        <span>User Flows</span>
    </div>

    <section class="content-section">
        <h2>From Linear Pathway to Flexible Flows</h2>
        <p>
            To translate the printed pathway into something students could actually use, we first separated
            <strong>purpose</strong> from <strong>presentation</strong>. The pathway’s steps remained our backbone, but
            we redesigned how students could enter, exit, and loop through them.
        </p>
        <h3>Multiple Starting Points</h3>
        <p>
            The user flow team designed a system where students could begin from four primary intents:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>“I want to find a research opportunity.”</strong></li>
            <li><strong>“I want to learn what research is.”</strong></li>
            <li><strong>“I need funding or scholarships.”</strong></li>
            <li><strong>“I’m preparing to present or attend a conference.”</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Each path routes students to the most relevant tools—like OURConnect, “Getting Started” content, or
            conference resources—without forcing them through irrelevant steps.
        </p>

        <h3>Functionality Mapped to Goals</h3>
        <p>
            We anchored the flow around when students should use OUR-specific tools:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>OURConnect</strong> appears when students are ready to browse or filter concrete opportunities.</li>
            <li><strong>Help & FAQ</strong> supports students who are unsure which step they’re on.</li>
            <li><strong>Staff and appointment pathways</strong> are surfaced when human guidance is most valuable.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Sketching the Experience</h2>
        <p>
            The prototype team interpreted the user flow into <strong>low-fidelity screen sketches</strong> across the
            core areas of the site: homepage, search, conferences, scholarships & grants, staff, and FAQ/help.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Homepage</strong> – 3–4 prominent buttons became “starting points” that mirror the new flow,
                plus a clear entry into OURConnect.</li>
            <li><strong>Search Opportunities</strong> – A filterable catalog centered on students’ mental models:
                topic, time commitment, department, and eligibility.</li>
            <li><strong>Conferences</strong> – A calendar/grid layout surfaced dates, deadlines, and participation
                options at a glance.</li>
            <li><strong>Scholarships & Grants</strong> – Dense text was broken into scannable cards explaining
                differences between funding types.</li>
            <li><strong>OUR Staff</strong> – Direct contact and appointment options reduced friction for students
                seeking one-on-one guidance.</li>
            <li><strong>FAQ & Help</strong> – Consolidated common questions to reduce unnecessary page-hopping and
                scrolling.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We validated these sketches with <strong>5 undergraduates</strong> and <strong>1 graduate student</strong>
            to confirm whether layout and labels matched their expectations.

        <h2>Low-Fidelity Prototype & Testing</h2>
        <p>
            Using our validated sketches, we built an <strong>interactive low-fidelity prototype</strong> that followed
            the new user flow from entry point to opportunity discovery.
        </p>
        <p>
            We then asked <strong>5 undergraduate students</strong> with little to no research experience to complete
            tasks that mirrored the printed pathway, such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Find a research opportunity aligned with your interests.</li>
            <li>Locate information on conferences and how to attend.</li>
            <li>Figure out what to do if you’re completely new to research.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Students reported that the new prototype was <strong>clearer and easier to navigate</strong> than the
            current OUR website. They especially appreciated seeing their next step and having multiple ways to get help.

        <h3>Iterating on Help & Guidance</h3>
        <p>
            Testing also revealed gaps:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Students wanted a dedicated <strong>“Getting Started” page</strong> that walked through the research
                process in plain language.</li>
            <li>Conference pages needed clearer explanations of <strong>applying vs. attending</strong> and what each
                required.</li>
            <li>Help content was too hidden in the navigation; students wanted support surfaced alongside primary tasks.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
        <h2>Mid-Fidelity Refinement</h2>
        <p>
            We incorporated feedback into a <strong>mid-fidelity prototype</strong> aligned with Purdue’s branding:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Added a <strong>“Getting Started” page</strong> with step-by-step visual guidance for new researchers.</li>
            <li>Reworked the <strong>Spring Conference page</strong> to support both presenters and attendees, with
                dates and deadlines called out visually.</li>
            <li>Clarified copy and structure across funding, opportunities, and help pages.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Additional usability testing showed that the revised flow felt <strong>intuitive and stable</strong>; no
            major structural changes were requested, which allowed us to focus on content clarity and interaction polish
            in the high-fidelity prototype.

            We delivered an <strong>annotated user flow</strong> alongside the prototype, documenting the rationale
            behind each decision and how it ties back to user research, current-state testing, and stakeholder goals.

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p class="highlight-box">
            This project reinforced that <strong>pathways are lived, not just diagrammed</strong>. A beautiful
            infographic can break down the process on paper, but if the website doesn’t reflect how students actually
            move, they will still feel lost.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Multiple entry points are essential.</strong> Students at different stages of experience and
                confidence need tailored on-ramps into the same ecosystem.</li>
            <li><strong>Research-to-design traceability matters.</strong> Our annotated flow helped stakeholders see
                exactly how each interaction was grounded in user evidence.</li>
            <li><strong>Support is part of the product.</strong> Surfacing help, staff, and “what to do next” is as
                important as listing opportunities.</li>
